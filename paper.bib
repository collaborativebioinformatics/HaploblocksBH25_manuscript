               population stands to benefit immensely from therapeutic
               approaches tailored to the underlying genetic causes. Here, we
               review recent advances in understanding novel genotype-phenotype
               relationships and how these can improve the care of patients with
               inherited DCM. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last several years,
               discovery of novel DCM-associated genes, gene-specific DCM
               outcomes, and nuanced information about variant-environment
               interactions have advanced our understanding of inherited DCM.
               Specifically, novel associations of genes with specific clinical
               phenotypes can help to assess sudden cardiac death risk and guide
               counseling around behavioral and environmental exposures that may
               worsen disease. Important expansions of the current
               genotype-phenotype profiling include the newly DCM-associated
               FLNC variant, prognostically significant LMNA, DSP inflammatory
               cardiomyopathy, and the highly penetrant features of RBM20

               directions to improve diagnostic accuracy and prognostic
               improvement in DCM will center not just on identification of new
               genes, but also on understanding the interaction of known and
               novel variants in known DCM genes with patient genetic background

               these influences could reveal new biological mechanisms and
               enhance risk prediction for monogenic diseases. Here we show that
               polygenic background substantially shapes the clinical
               presentation of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a
               common monogenic form of diabetes that typically presents in
               adolescence or early adulthood. We find strong enrichment of type
               2 diabetes (T2D) polygenic risk, but not type 1 diabetes risk, in
               genetically confirmed MODY cases (n = 1,462). This T2D polygenic
               burden, primarily through beta-cell dysfunction pathways, is
               strongly associated with earlier age of diagnosis and increased
               diabetes severity. Common genetic variants collectively account
               for 24\% (P < 0.0001) of the phenotypic variability. Using a
               large population cohort (n = 424,553), we demonstrate that T2D
               polygenic burden substantially modifies diabetes onset in
               individuals with pathogenic variants, with diabetes risk ranging
               from 11\% to 81\%. Finally, we show that individuals with
               MODY-like phenotypes (n = 300) without a causal variant have
               elevated polygenic burden for T2D and related traits,
               representing potential polygenic phenocopies. These findings
               reveal substantial influence of common genetic variation in
               shaping the clinical presentation of early-onset monogenic
               disorders. Incorporating these may improve risk estimates for

               This is partly because of the severe erosion of statistical power
               resulting from the massive number of statistical tests required
               to detect such interactions. Here, we focus on improving the
               power of GxE tests by developing a statistical framework for
               assessing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the
               trait means and/or trait variances. When applying this framework

               (vQTLs) compared to when assessing all genetic variants.

               such as diabetes or ulcerative colitis. We show that GxE effects

  abstract  = "A monogenic etiology can be identified in up to 40\% of people
               with severe epilepsy. To address earlier and more appropriate
               treatment strategies, clinicians are required to know the
               implications that specific genetic causes might have on
               pathophysiology, natural history, comorbidities, and treatment
               choices. In this narrative review, we summarize concepts on the
               genetic epilepsies based on the underlying pathophysiologic
               mechanisms and present the current knowledge on treatment options
               based on evidence provided by controlled trials or studies with
               lower classification of evidence. Overall, evidence robust enough
               to guide antiseizure medication (ASM) choices in genetic
               epilepsies remains limited to the more frequent conditions for
               which controlled trials and observational studies have been
               possible. Most monogenic disorders are very rare and ASM choices
               for them are still based on inferences drawn from observational
               studies and early, often anecdotal, experiences with precision
               therapies. Precision medicine remains applicable to only a narrow
               number of patients with monogenic epilepsies and may target only
               part of the actual functional defects. Phenotypic heterogeneity
               is remarkable, and some genetic mutations activate
               epileptogenesis through their developmental effects, which may
               not be reversed postnatally. Other genes seem to have pure
               functional consequences on excitability, acting through either
               loss- or gain-of-function effects, and these may have opposite
               treatment implications. In addition, the functional consequences
               of missense mutations may be difficult to predict, making
               precision treatment approaches considerably more complex than
               estimated by deterministic interpretations. Knowledge of genetic
               etiologies can influence the approach to surgical treatment of
               focal epilepsies. Identification of germline mutations in
               specific genes contraindicates surgery while mutations in other
               genes do not. Identification, quantification, and functional
               characterization of specific somatic mutations before surgery
               using CSF liquid biopsy or after surgery in brain specimens will
               likely be integrated in planning surgical strategies and
               reintervention after a first unsuccessful surgery as initial
               evidence suggests that mutational load may correlate with the
               epileptogenic zone. Promising future directions include gene
               manipulation by DNA or mRNA targeting; although most are still
               far from clinical use, some are in early phase clinical
               development.",

               mechanisms underlying Parkinsonian conditions. Monogenic
               Parkinsonisms can present autosomal dominant, autosomal

              the effect of common, low penetrant genetic variants associated
              with colorectal cancer (CRC), can be used for risk stratification.
              METHODS: To assess the combined impact of the PRS and other main
              factors on CRC risk, 163,516 individuals from the UK Biobank were
              stratified as follows: 1. carriers status for germline pathogenic
              variants (PV) in CRC susceptibility genes (APC, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
              PMS2), 2. low ( 80\%), and 3. family history (FH) of CRC.
              Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards
              models were applied to compare odds ratios and to compute the
              lifetime incidence, respectively. RESULTS: Depending on the PRS,
              the CRC lifetime incidence for non-carriers ranges between 6 and
              22\%, compared to 40\% and 74\% for carriers. A suspicious FH is
              associated with a further increase of the cumulative incidence
              reaching 26\% for non-carriers and 98\% for carriers. In
              non-carriers without FH, but high PRS, the CRC risk is doubled,
              whereas a low PRS even in the context of a FH results in a
              decreased risk. The full model including PRS, carrier status, and
              FH improved the area under the curve in risk prediction (0.704).
              CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that CRC risks are strongly
              influenced by the PRS for both a sporadic and monogenic
              background. FH, PV, and common variants complementary contribute
              to CRC risk. The implementation of PRS in routine care will likely
              improve personalized risk stratification, which will in turn guide
              tailored preventive surveillance strategies in high, intermediate,
              and low risk groups.",

               mutations in MC4R, is the most common cause of monogenic forms of
               obesity. However, these mutations have often been identified in
               small-scale, case-focused studies. Here, we assess the penetrance
               of previously reported MC4R mutations at a population level.
               Furthermore, we examine why some carriers of pathogenic mutations
               remain of normal weight, to gain insight into the mechanisms that
               control body weight. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified 59 known
               obesity-increasing mutations in MC4R from the Human Gene Mutation
               Database (HGMD) and Clinvar. We assessed their penetrance and
               effect on obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m2) in >450,000
               individuals (age 40-69 years) of the UK Biobank, a
               population-based cohort study. Of these 59 mutations, only 11 had
               moderate-to-high penetrance and increased the odds of obesity by
               more than 2-fold. We subsequently focused on these 11 mutations
               and examined differences between carriers of normal weight and
               carriers with obesity. Twenty-eight of the 182 carriers of these
               11 mutations were of normal weight. Body composition of carriers
               of normal weight was similar to noncarriers of normal weight,
               whereas among individuals with obesity, carriers had a somewhat
               higher BMI than noncarriers (1.44 ± 0.07 standard deviation
               scores [SDSs] ± standard error [SE] versus 1.29 ± 0.001, P =
               0.03), because of greater lean mass (1.44 ± 0.09 versus 1.15 ±
               0.002, P = 0.002). Carriers of normal weight more often reported
               that, already at age 10 years, their body size was below average
               or average (72\%) compared with carriers with obesity (48\%) (P =
               0.01). To assess the polygenic contribution to body weight in
               carriers of normal weight and carriers with obesity, we
               calculated a genome-wide polygenic risk score for BMI (PRSBMI).
               The PRSBMI of carriers of normal weight (PRSBMI = -0.64 ± 0.18)
               was significantly lower than of carriers with obesity (0.40 ±
               0.11; P = 1.7 × 10-6), and tended to be lower than that of
               noncarriers of normal weight (-0.29 ± 0.003; P = 0.05). Among
               carriers, those with a low PRSBMI (bottom quartile) have an
               approximately 5-kg/m2 lower BMI (approximately 14 kg of body
               weight for a 1.7-m-tall person) than those with a high PRS (top
               quartile). Because the UK Biobank population is healthier than
               the general population in the United Kingdom, penetrance may have
               been somewhat underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that
               large-scale data are needed to validate the impact of mutations
               observed in small-scale and case-focused studies. Furthermore, we
               observed that despite the key role of MC4R in obesity, the
               effects of pathogenic MC4R mutations may be countered, at least
               in part, by a low polygenic risk potentially representing other
               innate mechanisms implicated in body weight regulation.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Genetic studies have implicated rare and common
               variations in liability for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Of
               the discovered risk variants, those rare in the population
               invariably have large impact on liability, while common variants
               have small effects. Yet, collectively, common risk variants
               account for the majority of population-level variability. How
               these rare and common risk variants jointly affect liability for
               individuals requires further study. METHODS: To explore how
               common and rare variants jointly affect liability, we assessed
               two cohorts of ASD families characterized for rare and common
               genetic variations (Simons Simplex Collection and
               Population-Based Autism Genetics and Environment Study). We
               analyzed data from 3011 affected subjects, as well as two cohorts
               of unaffected individuals characterized for common genetic
               variation: 3011 subjects matched for ancestry to ASD subjects and
               11,950 subjects for estimating allele frequencies. We used
               genetic scores, which assessed the relative burden of common
               genetic variation affecting risk of ASD (henceforth ``burden''),
               and determined how this burden was distributed among three
               subpopulations: ASD subjects who carry a potentially damaging
               variant implicated in risk of ASD (``PDV carriers''); ASD
               subjects who do not (``non-carriers''); and unaffected subjects
               who are assumed to be non-carriers. RESULTS: Burden harbored by
               ASD subjects is stochastically greater than that harbored by
               control subjects. For PDV carriers, their average burden is
               intermediate between non-carrier ASD and control subjects. Both
               carrier and non-carrier ASD subjects have greater burden, on
               average, than control subjects. The effects of common and rare
               variants likely combine additively to determine individual-level
               liability. LIMITATIONS: Only 305 ASD subjects were known PDV
               carriers. This relatively small subpopulation limits this study
               to characterizing general patterns of burden, as opposed to
               effects of specific PDVs or genes. Also, a small fraction of
               subjects that are categorized as non-carriers could be PDV
               carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Liability arising from common and rare
               risk variations likely combines additively to determine risk of
               any individual diagnosed with ASD. On average, ASD subjects carry
               a substantial burden of common risk variation, even if they also
               carry a rare PDV affecting risk.",

               Parkinson's disease (PD); however, questions remain regarding the
               penetrance, clinical phenotype and natural history of carriers.
               We performed a 3.5-year prospective longitudinal online study in
               a large number of 1286 genotyped LRRK2 G2019S carriers and 109
               154 controls, with and without PD, recruited from the 23andMe
               Research Cohort. We collected self-reported motor and non-motor
               symptoms every 6 months, as well as demographics, family
               histories and environmental risk factors. Incident cases of PD
               (phenoconverters) were identified at follow-up. We determined
               lifetime risk of PD using accelerated failure time modelling and
               explored the impact of polygenic risk on penetrance. We also
               computed the genetic ancestry of all LRRK2 G2019S carriers in the
               23andMe database and identified regions of the world where
               carrier frequencies are highest. We observed that despite a 1
               year longer disease duration (P = 0.016), LRRK2 G2019S carriers
               with PD had similar burden of motor symptoms, yet significantly
               fewer non-motor symptoms including cognitive difficulties, REM
               sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and hyposmia (all P-values ≤
               0.0002). The cumulative incidence of PD in G2019S carriers by age
               80 was 49\%. G2019S carriers had a 10-fold risk of developing PD
               versus non-carriers. This rose to a 27-fold risk in G2019S
               carriers with a PD polygenic risk score in the top 25\% versus
               non-carriers in the bottom 25\%. In addition to identifying
               ancient founding events in people of North African and Ashkenazi
               descent, our genetic ancestry analyses infer that the G2019S
               variant was later introduced to Spanish colonial territories in
               the Americas. Our results suggest LRRK2 G2019S PD appears to be a
               slowly progressive predominantly motor subtype of PD with a lower
               prevalence of hyposmia, RBD and cognitive impairment. This
               suggests that the current prodromal criteria, which are based on
               idiopathic PD, may lack sensitivity to detect the early phases of
               LRRK2 PD in G2019S carriers. We show that polygenic burden may
               contribute to the development of PD in the LRRK2 G2019S carrier
               population. Collectively, the results should help support
               screening programmes and candidate enrichment strategies for
               upcoming trials of LRRK2 inhibitors in early-stage disease.",

                 were successfully replicated in independent cohorts from the

                 that did not present significant marginal association and might
                 explain part of the missing heritability for these diseases. In
                 10 phenotypes we show the presence of epistasis between common
                 variants with intermediate to large effect size (OR> 2)
                 supporting the hypothesis that common diseases are modulated by
                 common variants. Most of the variants in interactions (82\%)
                 were more than 1Mb apart and cis-epistasis was hardly found
                 outside the HLA region. Functional annotation of the variants
                 suggests that most mechanisms behind epistasis occurs at the
                 supra pathway level and that intra-gene or intra-pathway
                 epistasis is rare. Surprisingly we find a significant biais
                 toward antagonistic epistasis, representing 60\% to 95\% of
                 interactions. In type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism, disorders of
                 mineral absorption, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and multiple
                 sclerosis more than 50\% of interactions were completely
                 compensating the effect of the marginally associated variant.
                 In psoriasis we identified an interaction between a stop gain
                 variant in CCHCR1 with two missense variants in MUC22 and
                 HSPA1L leading to a 3 fold increase of the effect of CCHCR1
                 variant on disease risk. Our study shows that there is still
                 much to discover in epistasis and we provide the full summary

               a pangenome reference and to understand the extent of complex
               structural variation. Here we sequence 65 diverse human genomes
               and build 130 haplotype-resolved assemblies (median continuity of
               130 Mb), closing 92\% of all previous assembly gaps1,2 and
               reaching telomere-to-telomere status for 39\% of the chromosomes.
               We highlight complete sequence continuity of complex loci,
               including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), SMN1/SMN2,
               NBPF8 and AMY1/AMY2, and fully resolve 1,852 complex structural
               variants. In addition, we completely assemble and validate 1,246
               human centromeres. We find up to 30-fold variation in α-satellite
               higher-order repeat array length and characterize the pattern of
               mobile element insertions into α-satellite higher-order repeat
               arrays. Although most centromeres predict a single site of
               kinetochore attachment, epigenetic analysis suggests the presence
               of two hypomethylated regions for 7\% of centromeres. Combining
               our data with the draft pangenome reference1 significantly
               enhances genotyping accuracy from short-read data, enabling
               whole-genome inference3 to a median quality value of 45. Using
               this approach, 26,115 structural variants per individual are
               detected, substantially increasing the number of structural
               variants now amenable to downstream disease association studies.",

  abstract  = "Numerous common genetic variants have been linked to breast
               cancer risk, but they only partially explain the total breast
               cancer heritability. Inference from Nordic population-based twin
               data indicates rare high-risk loci as the chief determinant of
               breast cancer risk. Here, we use haplotypes, rather than single
               variants, to identify rare high-risk loci for breast cancer. With
               computationally phased genotypes from 181,034 white British women
               in the UK Biobank, a genome-wide haplotype-breast cancer
               association analysis was conducted using sliding windows of 5 to
               500 consecutive array-genotyped variants. In the discovery stage,
               haplotype-breast cancer associations were evaluated
               retrospectively in the prestudy-enrollment data including 5,487
               breast cancer cases. Breast cancer hazard ratios (HR) for
               additive haplotypic effects were estimated using Cox regression.
               The replication analysis included a prospective cohort of women
               free of breast cancer at enrollment, of whom 3,524 later
               developed breast cancer. This two-stage analysis detected 13 rare
               loci (frequency <1\%), each associated with an appreciable breast
               cancer-risk increase (discovery: HRs = 2.84-6.10, P < 5 × 10-8;
               replication: HRs = 2.08-5.61, P < 0.01). In contrast, the
               variants that formed these rare haplotypes individually exhibited
               much smaller effects. Functional annotation revealed extensive
               cis-regulatory DNA elements in breast cancer-related cells
               underlying the replicated rare haplotypes. Using phased, imputed
               genotypes from 30,064 cases and 25,282 controls in the DRIVE
               OncoArray case-control study, 6 of the 13 rare-loci associations
               were found generalizable (odds ratio estimates: 1.48-7.67, P <
               0.05). This study demonstrates the complementary advantage of
               utilizing rare haplotypes to capture novel risk loci and suggests
               the potential for the discovery of more genetic elements
               contributing to cancer heritability as large data sets of
               germline whole-genome sequencing become available. SIGNIFICANCE:
               A genome-wide two-stage haplotype analysis identifies rare
               haplotypes associated with breast cancer risk and suggests that
               the rare risk haplotypes represent long-range interactions with
               regulatory consequences influencing cancer risk.",

              biobank-scale genealogies from sequencing or genotyping array
              data, as well as strategies to utilize genealogies to perform
              association and other complex trait analyses. We use these methods
              to build genome-wide genealogies using genotyping data for 337,464
              UK Biobank individuals and test for association across seven
              complex traits. Genealogy-based association detects more rare and
              ultra-rare signals (N = 134, frequency range 0.0007-0.1\%) than
              genotype imputation using ~65,000 sequenced haplotypes (N = 64).
              In a subset of 138,039 exome sequencing samples, these

              variants enriched (4.8×) for loss-of-function variation. These
